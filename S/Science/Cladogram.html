        <h2>.  Cladograms are diagrams which depict the relationships between different groups of animals called "clades". By depict ing these relationships, cladograms reconstruct the evolutionary history. Cladograms can also be called "phylogenies" or "trees". Key aspects of a cladogram are the root, clades, nodes, and nodes. The root is the initial ancestor that is common to all groups branching off from it. The clades are the branches that indicate related groups and their common ancestors. Nodes are the points that indicate the hypothetical ancestors.</h2>
